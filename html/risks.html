<h1 align="center">What are the risks and benefits of participating?</h1>
<p>The goal of this study is to learn about the causes of various diseases, with the hope of improving the health of current and future generations. Because this is a long-term study, it may not benefit you directly. <a href="#" title="Benefits" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="focus" data-content="Studies like this one provide an important opportunity to collect information on factors that may affect risk of disease but participating may not benefit you directly at this time. Many people who volunteer do so with the hope that health research may improve our understanding of diseases like cancer and ultimately advance science and improve medicine. Other people hope that there will be a benefit for their children."><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></a></p>

<p>There is a small chance that participation in this study may involve a loss of privacy if someone who is not authorized gets access to the data we have stored about you. We will make every effort to prevent that from happening. <a href="#" title="Privacy" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="focus" data-content="When you complete the online surveys and when data are entered into computer files for analysis, your answers will be identified only be a special study identification number known to you and research team members. Your social security number and any other personal identification information (PII) will be removed from your survey and data file. Even if someone broke into the data files, they would not be able to identify you. To minimize the risk of breaking into the data files, the files will be maintained on secure servers and protected by all the measures required by government computer security regulations. We will not label your stored samples with information that can identify you. We will keep any information that can be traced back to you as private as possible."><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></a></p>
<p>There is a small risk of health insurance discrimination based on genetic testing; however, you are protected by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA). <a href="#" title="Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="focus" data-content="As per GINA, group and individual health insurers may not use your genetic information to set insurance eligibility, premiums, or contribution amounts, nor can they request or require that you take a genetic test. In addition, employers with 15 or more employees may notÂ use your genetic information to make decisions regarding hiring, firing, job assignments, or promotions, nor can they request, require, or purchase your genetic information. In Ohio, there is a similar state law that also provides some protection for private health insurance plans. GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life, disability, or long-term care insurance."><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></a></p>  
<p>The most common physical risks are minimal and are related to drawing blood from your arm, including brief pain and/or bruising.</p>
<p>There are no costs to you to take part in the study, and you will not be paid for taking part.</p>
